Hey there
<br>
I know I am adding README very late, but better late than never so yeah here it is, another weirdo code which should not be on github, but sadly it is and will remain here.
<br>
I dont think any explanation should be given here as I hardcoded it and nutured it with me blood and sweat, so no error can be triggered I guess and It's each step or anything you say is super self explanatory.
